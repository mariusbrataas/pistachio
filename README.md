Iâ€™m trying to learn more about machine learning and AI. In doing so I made this little library :)

Feel free to use it, or contribute! I will keep posting updates with new algorithms and Jupyter Notebooks to accompany them.

Current notebooks:

- [Teaching an RNN to recognize handwritten digits](https://github.com/mariusbrataas/pistachio/blob/master/rnn_mnist.ipynb)
- [Using centroid-based clustering to group languages by similarity](https://github.com/mariusbrataas/pistachio/blob/master/centroid_cluster_languages.ipynb)

Suggestions for contributions:

- Dimensionality reduction
- Other clustering algorithms
- LSTM and convolutional layers for the neural net
- Cost functions (not implemented yet...)
- Notebooks of your own?
- Anything else you can think of!

Please just stick with this mindset: I want to use only numpy. I wrote this library while learning the maths behind this stuff. I want the code to be readable and understandable to myself and anyone else who want to get into the nitty gritty bits of ML.

Happy hacking!
